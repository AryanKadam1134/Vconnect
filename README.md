#VConnect
Problem Statement :
There is a disconnect between volunteers and event organizers. Volunteering opportunities often suffer from poor engagement and high dropout rates due to lack of motivation and boring, outdated systems that disconnect volunteers from organizers, making it difficult to find, participate in, and manage volunteering activities efficiently.

Solution : 
VConnect is a gamified web platform that connects volunteers with organizers by offering event management tools, a points-based reward system (AURA), and social features to make volunteering engaging and rewarding, while generating revenue through premium services and sponsored content.




# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
