# VConnect - Gamified Volunteer Connection Platform

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Volunteering opportunities often suffer from poor engagement and high dropout rates due to lack of motivation and boring, outdated systems that disconnect volunteers from organizers, making it difficult to find, participate in, and manage volunteering activities efficiently.

## 💡 Solution
VConnect is a gamified web platform that connects volunteers with organizers by offering event management tools, a points-based reward system (AURA), and social features to make volunteering engaging and rewarding, while generating revenue through premium services and sponsored content.
